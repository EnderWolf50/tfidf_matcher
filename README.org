# TITLE: =tf_idf matcher=

=tfidf_matcher= is a package for fuzzymatching large datasets together. Most fuzzy
matching libraries like =fuzzywuzzy= get great results, but perform very poorly
due to their O(n^2) complexity. This package does things a little bit differently.

* TODO How does it work?
It works by splitting the search space into multiple n-grams, generating a
sparse

* TODO Yeah ok, but how do I use it?

* TODO Strengths and Weaknesses

* TODO Who do I thank?
Credit goes to this [[https://towardsdatascience.com/fuzzy-matching-at-scale-84f2bfd0c536][this blog post by Josh Taylor]] for the base idea behind the
project. I wanted to build it out for two reasons:
1. Package building experience.
2. Utility for future projects which may require large-domain fuzzy matching.
